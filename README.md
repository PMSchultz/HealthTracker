# HealthTracker

HealthTracker is a covenient app that keeps medical records for you and your family.  Easily create charts for yourself and individual family members.  Enter allergies, medications, immunizations, office visits, and hospitalizations and have that information available anytime. Can't remember how long it's been since you had a tetanus shot...find the date easily on HealthTracker.  The daycare or school needs a copy of your child's immunization record...the information you need is on your child's immunization chart on HealthTracker.  Perhaps you are on vacation and find yourself after hours in an Urgent Care or Emergency Room with no access to your doctor's office or medical records...you always have your chart with you with HealthTracker.  

## Action Items
* Allergy input - finish code to add an allergy from the spinner to the patients chart, checking for empty input and
adding code to compare input with previous chart items.  Allow user to input only one allergy item at a time.
* Allergy record - sort patient record by allergy type and display
* Hospitalizations - verify that code checks for all required items before allowing record to be added
* Medications - verify that code checks for all required items before allowing record to be added
* Office Visits- verify that code checks for all required items before allowing record to be added
* Final test for errors in logic

## Stretch Goals
* Immunizations - change existing user input method. Use a check item list of immunizations obtained from a database.  Store each immunization in a separate record for ease of future editing
* Medications - Use FDA current list of approved drugs in an AutoCompleteTextView.  Add over-the-counter/vitamin/herbal
supplement fields.
* Imaging Results- add an imaging results patient chart section
* Lab Results - add a lab results patient chart section
* Blood Pressure Tracker - add an input page for blood pressures (perhaps adding a graph of results)
* Blood Glucose Tracker - add an input page for blood glucose (perhaps adding a graph of results)
* Ability to post pdf files to patient chart
* Develop app for ios
